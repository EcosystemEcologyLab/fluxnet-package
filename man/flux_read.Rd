\title{Read in FLUXNET data}
\usage{
flux_read(
  manifest,
  resolution = c("y", "m", "w", "d", "h"),
  datasets = c("ERA5", "FLUXMET"),
  site_ids = "all"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{manifest}{A manifest data frame produced by \code{\link[=flux_discover_files]{flux_discover_files()}}.}

\item{resolution}{The time resolution to read in.  Must be one of \code{"y"}
(annual), \code{"m"} (monthly), \code{"w"} (weekly), \code{"d"} (daily), or \code{"h"}
(hourly).}

\item{datasets}{Character vector of one or both of \code{"FLUXMET"} or \code{"ERA5"}.
Defaults to both.}

\item{site_ids}{A vector of site IDs to filter the manifest by.  If \code{"all"}
(the default), the manifest isn't filtered by site ID.}
}
\description{
Reads and minimally cleans FLUXNET data found by \code{\link[=flux_discover_files]{flux_discover_files()}}.
