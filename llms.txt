# fluxnet

`fluxnet` is an R package that provides utilities to download
[FLUXNET](https://fluxnet.org) data from member networks, read in those
data, perform basic quality control checks, and create exploratory
visualizations and data inventories.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fluxnet from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("EcosystemEcologyLab/fluxnet-package")
```

## Data Use Requirements

The FLUXNET data are shared under a CC-BY-4.0 data use license which
requires attribution for each data use. You can see the citations for
each site in the result of
[`flux_listall()`](https://ecosystemecologylab.github.io/fluxnet-package/reference/flux_listall.md)
and view the license document contained within each FLUXNET data product
(downloaded zip files).

To use the `fluxnet` R package to download data, you’ll also need to
install the `fluxnet-shuttle` command-line utility, found at
<https://github.com/fluxnet/shuttle>.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(fluxnet)
## List all available FLUXNET data
flux_listall()

## Download all available FLUXNET data
flux_download()

## Extract all the annual data files from the downloads
flux_extract(resolutions = "y")

## Create manifest
manifest <- flux_discover_files()

## Read in data
annual <- flux_read(manifest, resolution = "y")
```
